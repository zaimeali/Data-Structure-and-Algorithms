## Memoization

1. Make it work (Recursive - Brute Force)
   - Visualize problem as a tree
   - Implement the tree using recursion
   - Test it
2. Make it efficient
   - Add memo object (to store repeated items)
   - Add base case to return memo values
   - store return values into the memo

## Tabulation

1. Visualize the problem as Table
2. Size the table based on the inputs
3. Initialize the table with default values
4. Seed the trivial answer into the table
5. Iterate through the table
6. Fill further positions based on current position
